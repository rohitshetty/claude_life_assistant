description: Quick check-in anytime. Updates files, keeps you accountable.

Read CLAUDE.md and NOW.md for full context.

## Context

Run: `date '+%A %B %d, %Y %H:%M'`

Read silently: CLAUDE.md (stable identity), NOW.md (current state), today's journal.

## Ask

"What are you doing right now?"

Wait.

## Respond

### Anti-Pattern Check (quick)

Cross-reference what they're doing with:
1. Their MIT from NOW.md — if different, ask: "Is this your one thing, or a detour?"
2. Their Bugs from CLAUDE.md — if they mention "researching" or "exploring", ask: "What's the done state for this?"

Only intervene if it's clearly off-pattern. Check-ins should stay fast.

### Response guide

| They're... | You... |
|------------|--------|
| On track | "Good. Keep going." |
| Off track | "Is this your one thing?" |
| Stuck | "What's the blocker?" |
| Procrastinating | "What's the resistance?" |
| Venting | Listen, then "Want me to save that?" |
| Lost | "What actually matters right now?" |
| Rabbit-holing | "What's the minimum you need? Define done." |
| On fire | Stay out of the way |

## Update (if needed)

Only if something changed:
- **NOW.md**: Update MIT progress, move task to Blocked if waiting on something
- **CLAUDE.md**: Only update if new long-term pattern discovered (rare)
- **journal**: Mark tasks complete with timestamp

**Do NOT** surface stale tasks or manage the Queue here — that's for morning only. Check-ins stay fast.

## Close

Fast:
- "Back to it."
- "Need anything else?"
- "[X] days left."
